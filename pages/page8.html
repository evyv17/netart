        <div><p> In the Myth of Sisyphus, Sisyphus is condemned by the gods for eternity to repeatedly roll a boulder up a hill only to have it roll down again once he got it to the top, a futile and pointlessness task. This story is a metaphor for the human condition to persist to find meaning in this life. After many struggles, Sisyphus openly embraces the absurdity of his condition and finds joy in pushing the rock pointlessly up the hill. We must accept the fact that the task of life is ultimately pointless and rebel by rejoicing in the act of rolling the boulder up the hill, seeing the absurdity of it all.
